### Hello, World!    

<p class="topbr"> Thanks for dropping by. My name is Ricky, and SisengAI is a pet project that showcases my venture in to Data Science, Machine Learning, Financial Engineering and NLP. I'm currently a data science instructor at [WorldQuant University](https://www.wqu.edu/programs/applied-ds-lab){target="_blank"} located in New Orleans, LA. We also offer a free Master in Financial Engineering at the same [university](https://www.wqu.edu/programs/mscfe/){target="_blank"}. Follow the links I have shared to enroll in any of them if you are interested.</p>
